# Vulnerability & Exposure Management Report — Instructions

## Purpose

This skill generates a comprehensive **Vulnerability & Exposure Management Report** covering the full security posture of the organization (or a specific device). It goes beyond CVEs to include security configuration compliance, end-of-support software, Exposure Management critical assets, attack paths, and certificate status.

**Entity Type:** Organization-wide (default) or single device

| Scope | Primary Tables | Use Case |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Org-wide (default) | `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities`, `ExposureGraphNodes`, `ExposureGraphEdges` | Full organizational posture assessment |
| Per-device | `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities`, `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` | Focused device vulnerability review |

**What this skill covers:**

| Section | Data Source | Coverage |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| CVE Vulnerabilities | `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` + `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB` | Severity distribution, exploitable CVEs, CVSS scores |
| Security Configuration | `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` + `...KB` | OS, Network, Security Controls, Accounts, Application compliance |
| End-of-Support Software | `DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory` | EoS/EoL software with dates and affected devices |
| Critical Assets | `ExposureGraphNodes` | Criticality levels, internet-facing, RCE/privesc flags |
| Attack Paths | `ExposureGraphEdges` + `ExposureGraphNodes` | Multi-hop paths from vulnerable to critical assets |
| Defender Device Health | `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` + `DeviceInfo` | AV mode, signatures, RTP, tamper protection, cloud protection compliance by active/inactive status |
| Certificate Status | `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` | Expired and expiring certificates |
| Software Evidence (drill-down) | `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` | File paths, registry paths linking vulnerable software to on-disk locations — used for targeted remediation |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️

**Before starting ANY vulnerability/exposure report:**

1. **ALL queries in this skill use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`** — DeviceTvm* and ExposureGraph* tables are Advanced Hunting only (NOT in Sentinel Data Lake)
2. **No Sentinel workspace selection is required** — this skill does NOT query Sentinel Data Lake tables
3. **ALWAYS ask the user for output mode** if not specified: inline chat summary, markdown file report, or both (default: both)
4. **ALWAYS ask the user for scope** if ambiguous: org-wide (default) or specific device name
5. **ALWAYS run independent queries in parallel** for performance
6. **ALWAYS use `create_file` for markdown reports** (NEVER use PowerShell terminal commands)
7. **ALWAYS sanitize PII** from saved reports — use generic placeholders for real hostnames, tenant names, and UPNs in committed files (reports/ files for user's own use may contain real values)
8. **ExposureGraph tables are snapshot data** — no `Timestamp` or `TimeGenerated` filter needed
9. **DeviceTvm tables use `Timestamp`** — filter with `Timestamp > ago(1d)` for latest assessment snapshot

### Tool Selection

| Table Pattern | Tool | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------|
| `DeviceTvm*` | `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` | AH-only tables |
| `ExposureGraphNodes` | `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` | AH-only, snapshot data, no timestamp filter |
| `ExposureGraphEdges` | `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` | AH-only, snapshot data, no timestamp filter |

**🔴 PROHIBITED:**
- ❌ Using `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` for any table in this skill
- ❌ Adding `TimeGenerated` filters to ExposureGraph queries
- ❌ Reporting findings without actual query evidence
- ❌ Fabricating CVE IDs, CVSS scores, or device names

---

## Output Modes

### Mode 1: Inline Chat Summary (default for quick requests)
Compact executive summary rendered directly in chat.

### Mode 2: Markdown File Report
Full detailed report saved to `reports/exposure/vulnerability_exposure_report_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.md`.

### Mode 3: Both (default when user says "report" or "generate report")
Inline chat executive summary + full markdown file.

**Ask user if not specified:**
> "How would you like the report? I can provide:
> 1. **Inline chat summary** — executive overview in chat
> 2. **Markdown file** — detailed report saved to reports/exposure/
> 3. **Both** (recommended) — summary in chat + full report file"

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

**8-step execution pattern for org-wide report:**

```
Step 1: Determine scope (org-wide or specific device) and output mode
Step 2: Run Phase 1 queries in parallel — CVE distribution, exploitable CVEs, config compliance
Step 3: Run Phase 2 queries in parallel — EoS software, per-device vulns, per-device compliance
Step 4: Run Phase 3 queries in parallel — ExposureGraph critical assets, high-impact misconfigs, Defender health fleet summary
Step 5: Run Phase 4 queries in parallel — Attack paths, Defender health exceptions, certificates
Step 6: Run Phase 5 (optional) — Top vulnerable software, internet-facing critical assets
Step 7: Compute summary metrics and risk assessment
Step 8: Render inline chat executive summary
Step 9: Generate markdown file report (if requested)
```

---

## Sample KQL Queries

> **All queries use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`** via the Sentinel Triage MCP server.

### Query 1: CVE Severity Distribution

```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| summarize 
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceId),
    VulnCount = count()
    by VulnerabilitySeverityLevel
| order by VulnCount desc
```

**Purpose:** Top-level severity breakdown for executive summary.

---

### Query 2: Exploitable CVEs

```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| join kind=inner DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB on CveId
| where IsExploitAvailable == true
| summarize 
    AffectedDevices = dcount(DeviceName),
    DeviceList = make_set(DeviceName)
    by CveId, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel, CvssScore, VulnerabilityDescription
| order by CvssScore desc, AffectedDevices desc
| take 20
```

**Purpose:** Highest-risk CVEs — known exploits mean active threat. These are always Priority 1.

---

### Query 3: Security Config Compliance by Category

```kql
DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| summarize 
    TotalAssessments = count(),
    CompliantCount = countif(IsCompliant == true),
    NonCompliantCount = countif(IsCompliant == false)
    by ConfigurationCategory
| extend ComplianceRate = round(100.0 * CompliantCount / TotalAssessments, 1)
| order by NonCompliantCount desc
```

**Purpose:** Compliance posture across OS, Network, Security Controls, Accounts, Application categories.

---

### Query 4: End-of-Support Software

```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory
| where EndOfSupportStatus != ""
| summarize 
    AffectedDevices = dcount(DeviceId),
    DeviceList = make_set(DeviceName)
    by SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, EndOfSupportStatus, EndOfSupportDate
| order by AffectedDevices desc
```

**Purpose:** Identify unsupported software — no patches available, high risk.

**EndOfSupportStatus values:**
- `EOS Software` — Entire product line end-of-support
- `EOS Version` — Specific version end-of-support
- `Upcoming EOS Version` — EoS within next 6 months

---

### Query 5: Per-Device Vulnerability Counts

```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| summarize 
    Critical = countif(VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "Critical"),
    High = countif(VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "High"),
    Medium = countif(VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "Medium"),
    Low = countif(VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "Low"),
    Total = count()
    by DeviceName, OSPlatform
| order by Critical desc, High desc, Total desc
```

**Purpose:** Per-device vulnerability heatmap — identifies most vulnerable endpoints.

---

### Query 6: Per-Device Compliance Scorecard

```kql
DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| summarize 
    TotalChecks = count(),
    Compliant = countif(IsCompliant == true),
    NonCompliant = countif(IsCompliant == false),
    NotApplicable = countif(IsApplicable == false)
    by DeviceName
| extend ComplianceRate = round(100.0 * Compliant / (Compliant + NonCompliant), 1)
| order by ComplianceRate asc
```

**Purpose:** Rank devices by compliance rate — worst-first for remediation priority.

---

### Query 7: Critical Asset Inventory

> **🔴 MCP Property Access:** `NodeProperties` is stored as a JSON string. Direct dot-notation (`NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel`) returns null through MCP serialization. MUST use double `parse_json(tostring())` extraction — see [Known Pitfalls](#known-pitfalls).

```kql
ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| extend rawData = parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties)).rawData))
| extend critLevel = rawData.criticalityLevel
| extend critValue = toint(critLevel.criticalityLevel)
| extend ruleBasedCrit = toint(critLevel.ruleBasedCriticalityLevel)
| extend ruleNames = tostring(critLevel.ruleNames)
| where isnotnull(critLevel) and critValue < 4
| extend InternetFacing = iff(isnotnull(rawData.IsInternetFacing), "Yes", "No")
| extend VulnerableToRCE = iff(isnotnull(rawData.vulnerableToRCE), "Yes", "No")
| extend VulnerableToPrivEsc = iff(isnotnull(rawData.VulnerableToPrivilegeEscalation), "Yes", "No")
| extend ExposureScore = tostring(rawData.exposureScore)
| project 
    DeviceName = NodeName,
    CriticalityLevel = critValue,
    RuleBasedCriticality = ruleBasedCrit,
    RuleNames = ruleNames,
    InternetFacing,
    VulnerableToRCE,
    VulnerableToPrivEsc,
    ExposureScore,
    NodeLabel
| order by CriticalityLevel asc
```

**Purpose:** Inventory critical assets with exposure flags — feeds into prioritization.

**Criticality Levels:**
- **0-1**: Most critical (domain controllers, high-value servers)
- **2-3**: High priority
- **4+**: Standard (excluded from this query)

> **Note on zero results:** If this query returns 0 results, it means no devices have criticality classifications. Check the raw `NodeProperties` with `ExposureGraphNodes | where set_has_element(Categories, "device") | extend rawData = parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties)).rawData)) | project NodeName, rawData | take 5` to verify property structure. Criticality is auto-assigned for domain controllers (Level 0) and can be manually assigned in the Exposure Management portal.

---

### Query 8: High-Impact Misconfigurations

```kql
DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| where IsCompliant == false and IsApplicable == true
| summarize AffectedDevices = dcount(DeviceId), DeviceList = make_set(DeviceName) by ConfigurationId
| join kind=inner DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB on ConfigurationId
| project 
    ConfigurationId,
    ConfigurationName,
    ConfigurationCategory,
    ConfigurationSubcategory,
    ConfigurationImpact,
    RiskDescription,
    RemediationOptions,
    AffectedDevices,
    DeviceList
| order by ConfigurationImpact desc, AffectedDevices desc
| take 20
```

**Purpose:** Top misconfigurations ranked by impact score with actionable remediation steps from the KB.

**ConfigurationImpact scores:**
- **9-10**: Critical — must remediate immediately
- **7-8**: High — remediate in short term
- **4-6**: Medium — plan remediation
- **1-3**: Low — monitor

---

### Query 9: Defender Health Fleet Summary

```kql
// Defender Health Fleet Summary — compliance by control × OS × active/inactive status
// Active = DeviceInfo last seen within 7 days; Inactive = last seen > 7 days ago
// SCID Mapping:
//   Windows: scid-2010 (AVMode), scid-2011 (AVSignatures), scid-2012 (RTP),
//            scid-2013 (PUA), scid-2016 (CloudProtection), scid-2003 (TamperProtection),
//            scid-91 (BehaviourMonitoring), scid-2030 (CoreComponentsUpdate)
//   macOS:   scid-5090 (RTP), scid-5091 (PUA), scid-5094 (Cloud), scid-5095 (AVSigs)
//   Linux:   scid-6090 (RTP), scid-6091 (PUA), scid-6094 (Cloud), scid-6095 (AVSigs)
let defenderSCIDs = dynamic([
    "scid-2010", "scid-2011", "scid-2012", "scid-2013", "scid-2016", 
    "scid-2003", "scid-91", "scid-2030",
    "scid-5090", "scid-5091", "scid-5094", "scid-5095",
    "scid-6090", "scid-6091", "scid-6094", "scid-6095"
]);
let deviceStatus = DeviceInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName, OSPlatform) by DeviceId
| extend DeviceActivity = iff(Timestamp > ago(7d), "Active", "Inactive");
DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment
| where ConfigurationId in~ (defenderSCIDs)
| where IsApplicable == 1
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId, ConfigurationId
| extend Control = case(
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2010", "AVMode",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2011", "AVSignatures",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2012", "RealtimeProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2013", "PUAProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2016", "CloudProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2003", "TamperProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-91", "BehaviourMonitoring",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2030", "CoreComponentsUpdate",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5090", "RealtimeProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5091", "PUAProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5094", "CloudProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5095", "AVSignatures",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6090", "RealtimeProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6091", "PUAProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6094", "CloudProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6095", "AVSignatures",
    ConfigurationId)
| join kind=leftouter deviceStatus on DeviceId
| extend DeviceActivity = coalesce(DeviceActivity, "Unknown")
| summarize
    Compliant = countif(IsCompliant == 1),
    NonCompliant = countif(IsCompliant == 0),
    TotalDevices = dcount(DeviceId)
    by Control, OSPlatform, DeviceActivity
| extend ComplianceRate = round(100.0 * Compliant / (Compliant + NonCompliant), 1)
| order by DeviceActivity asc, Control asc, OSPlatform asc
```

**Purpose:** Fleet-scale Defender for Endpoint health dashboard. Shows compliance rates for each security control by OS platform, split by active/inactive device status. Designed for environments with 1000+ devices — does NOT list individual devices.

**Defender Controls Assessed:**

| Control | Description | Critical? |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| AVMode | Antivirus running in Active mode (vs Passive/EDR Blocked) | 🔴 Yes |
| AVSignatures | Antivirus signature definitions are current | 🟠 High |
| RealtimeProtection | Real-time file scanning enabled | 🔴 Yes |
| PUAProtection | Potentially Unwanted Application blocking enabled | 🟡 Medium |
| CloudProtection | Cloud-delivered protection (MAPS) enabled | 🟠 High |
| TamperProtection | Tamper Protection prevents disabling security settings | 🔴 Yes |
| BehaviourMonitoring | Behavioral analysis and monitoring enabled | 🟠 High |
| CoreComponentsUpdate | MDE unified agent / core components current | 🟡 Medium |

**Active vs Inactive Classification:**
- **Active**: Device last seen in `DeviceInfo` within 7 days — these are operational endpoints
- **Inactive**: Device last seen > 7 days ago — stale signature data is expected and should NOT be flagged as a security gap

> **Interpretation guidance:** Focus on active devices with non-compliant critical controls (AVMode, RTP, TamperProtection). Inactive devices with stale AVSignatures are expected — report as "X inactive devices not reporting" rather than "X devices with outdated signatures."

> **SCID reference:** Based on [Jeffrey Appel's Defender health guide](https://jeffreyappel.nl/how-to-check-for-a-healthy-defender-for-endpoint-environment/) and [Azure/Azure-Sentinel MDE_DeviceHealth.YAML](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Hunting%20Queries/Microsoft%20365%20Defender/General%20queries/MDE_DeviceHealth.yaml).

### Query 10a: Vulnerable Device Exposure Summary

```kql
ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| extend rawData = parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties)).rawData))
| extend HasHighCritVulns = isnotnull(rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights) 
    and tostring(parse_json(tostring(rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)).hasHighOrCritical) == "true"
| extend VulnerableToRCE = isnotnull(rawData.vulnerableToRCE)
| extend VulnerableToPrivEsc = isnotnull(rawData.VulnerableToPrivilegeEscalation)
| extend InternetFacing = isnotnull(rawData.IsInternetFacing)
| extend critLevel = rawData.criticalityLevel
| extend IsCritical = isnotnull(critLevel) and toint(critLevel.criticalityLevel) < 4
| summarize 
    TotalDevices = count(),
    HighCritVulnDevices = countif(HasHighCritVulns),
    RCEVulnDevices = countif(VulnerableToRCE),
    PrivEscVulnDevices = countif(VulnerableToPrivEsc),
    InternetFacingDevices = countif(InternetFacing),
    InternetFacingWithHighCritVulns = countif(InternetFacing and HasHighCritVulns),
    CriticalDevices = countif(IsCritical),
    CriticalWithHighCritVulns = countif(IsCritical and HasHighCritVulns)
```

**Purpose:** Fast single-table scan that produces executive-level exposure headlines:
- "X of Y devices have high/critical vulnerabilities"
- "Z internet-facing devices are vulnerable"
- "N critical assets have exploitable weaknesses"

> **Performance:** ⚡ Fast — single ExposureGraphNodes scan, no graph-match. Always runs in <5 seconds.

> **Key property:** `highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.hasHighOrCritical` is the reliable vulnerability flag on device nodes. The property is a nested JSON string requiring `parse_json(tostring(...))` to extract. See `queries/cloud/exposure_graph_attack_paths.md` Node Property Reference for full details.

---

### Query 10b: Edge Connectivity from Vulnerable Devices

```kql
let VulnDevices = ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| extend rawData = parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties)).rawData))
| where isnotnull(rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)
| extend HasHighCritVulns = tostring(parse_json(tostring(rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)).hasHighOrCritical) == "true"
| where HasHighCritVulns
| project NodeId;
let TargetNodes = ExposureGraphNodes
| project NodeId, TargetName = NodeName, TargetCategories = Categories, TargetLabel = NodeLabel;
ExposureGraphEdges
| join kind=inner VulnDevices on $left.SourceNodeId == $right.NodeId
| join kind=inner TargetNodes on $left.TargetNodeId == $right.NodeId
| extend TargetType = case(
    set_has_element(TargetCategories, "identity"), "Identity",
    set_has_element(TargetCategories, "compute"), "Compute",
    set_has_element(TargetCategories, "data"), "Data Store",
    set_has_element(TargetCategories, "ip_address"), "IP Address",
    tostring(TargetCategories))
| summarize 
    PathCount = count(),
    UniqueTargets = dcount(TargetNodeId),
    SampleTargets = make_set(TargetName, 5)
    by EdgeLabel, TargetType
| order by PathCount desc
```

**Purpose:** Shows the 1-hop blast radius shape from vulnerable devices WITHOUT expensive `graph-match`. Reveals:
- How many identities can be reached (lateral movement risk)
- How many Azure resources are reachable (data exfiltration risk)
- Which edge types dominate (authentication vs permissions vs network)

> **Performance:** ⚡ Fast — join-based aggregation, no `make-graph` or `graph-match`. Runs in <10 seconds even on large graphs.

> **Interpretation:** High counts on "can authenticate as" edges to identities indicate lateral movement risk. High counts on "has permissions to" edges to data stores indicate data exfiltration risk. Feed the most concerning edge types into Q16 (optional deep-dive) if needed.

> **Portal deep-dive:** For interactive multi-hop attack path exploration, use the [Exposure Management Attack Paths portal](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-management/attack-paths).

### Query 11: Defender Health Non-Compliant Exceptions

```kql
// Defender Health Non-Compliant Exceptions — exception-based, active devices only
// Groups non-compliant controls per device for fleet-scale readability
// Inactive devices excluded — stale signatures on offline devices are expected
let defenderSCIDs = dynamic([
    "scid-2010", "scid-2011", "scid-2012", "scid-2013", "scid-2016", 
    "scid-2003", "scid-91", "scid-2030",
    "scid-5090", "scid-5091", "scid-5094", "scid-5095",
    "scid-6090", "scid-6091", "scid-6094", "scid-6095"
]);
let deviceStatus = DeviceInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName, OSPlatform) by DeviceId
| extend DeviceActivity = iff(Timestamp > ago(7d), "Active", "Inactive"),
         LastSeen = Timestamp;
DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment
| where ConfigurationId in~ (defenderSCIDs)
| where IsApplicable == 1
| where IsCompliant == 0
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId, ConfigurationId
| extend Control = case(
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2010", "AVMode",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2011", "AVSignatures",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2012", "RealtimeProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2013", "PUAProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2016", "CloudProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2003", "TamperProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-91", "BehaviourMonitoring",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-2030", "CoreComponentsUpdate",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5090", "RealtimeProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5091", "PUAProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5094", "CloudProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-5095", "AVSignatures",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6090", "RealtimeProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6091", "PUAProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6094", "CloudProtection",
    ConfigurationId =~ "scid-6095", "AVSignatures",
    ConfigurationId)
| join kind=inner deviceStatus on DeviceId
| where DeviceActivity == "Active"
| summarize 
    NonCompliantControls = make_set(Control),
    FailedCount = dcount(Control),
    HighestImpact = max(toreal(ConfigurationImpact))
    by DeviceName, OSPlatform, LastSeen
| order by FailedCount desc, HighestImpact desc
| take 100
```

**Purpose:** Exception-based reporting — only surfaces active devices failing Defender health controls. Groups all non-compliant controls per device for fleet-scale readability (one row per problem device, not one row per failed check).

**Design for scale:**
- **Inner join** with `DeviceInfo` → only active devices (seen within 7 days)
- **Summarize by device** → one row per device listing all failed controls as an array
- **`take 100`** → practical limit for very large environments; increase if needed
- **Inactive devices excluded** → stale signatures on offline devices are expected, not actionable

> **Note:** If this query returns 0 results, that's a positive finding — report as "✅ All active devices pass all Defender health controls." If the fleet summary (Q9) shows non-compliant devices but all are Inactive, report as: "⚠️ X inactive devices have stale Defender configurations — verify if devices should be decommissioned or reconnected."

### Query 13: Certificate Expiration Status

> **🔴 CRITICAL:** `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` does **NOT** have a `DeviceName` column. You **MUST** join with `DeviceInfo` to resolve device names. Using `DeviceName` directly will fail with `SemanticError: Failed to resolve scalar expression named 'DeviceName'`. The query below already includes the required join. If the table returns empty or error, skip gracefully — it requires Defender Vulnerability Management add-on licensing.

```kql
DeviceTvmCertificateInfo
| extend Status = case(
    ExpirationDate < now(), "Expired",
    ExpirationDate < datetime_add('day', 30, now()), "Expiring within 30 days",
    "Valid"
)
| where Status != "Valid"
| summarize CertCount = count() by Status, DeviceId
| join kind=inner (
    DeviceInfo | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName) by DeviceId
) on DeviceId
| project DeviceName, Status, CertCount
| order by Status asc, CertCount desc
```

**Purpose:** Identify expired and soon-expiring certificates that can cause service outages or security gaps.

> **Note:** `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` does NOT have a `DeviceName` column — you must join with `DeviceInfo` to resolve device names. If the table returns empty or error, skip gracefully — it requires Defender Vulnerability Management add-on licensing.

### Query 14: Top Vulnerable Software

```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| summarize 
    CriticalCVEs = countif(VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "Critical"),
    HighCVEs = countif(VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "High"),
    TotalCVEs = count(),
    AffectedDevices = dcount(DeviceId)
    by SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName
| order by CriticalCVEs desc, HighCVEs desc, TotalCVEs desc
| take 15
```

**Purpose:** Identify which software products contribute the most vulnerabilities — useful for upgrade/removal decisions.

---

### Query 15: Internet-Facing Critical Assets with Vulnerabilities

```kql
ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "device")
| extend rawData = parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties)).rawData))
| extend critLevel = rawData.criticalityLevel
| where isnotnull(critLevel) and toint(critLevel.criticalityLevel) < 4
| where isnotnull(rawData.IsInternetFacing)
| extend VulnerableToRCE = isnotnull(rawData.vulnerableToRCE)
| extend VulnerableToPrivEsc = isnotnull(rawData.VulnerableToPrivilegeEscalation)
| project 
    DeviceName = NodeName,
    CriticalityLevel = toint(critLevel.criticalityLevel),
    VulnerableToRCE,
    VulnerableToPrivEsc,
    NodeLabel
| order by CriticalityLevel asc
```

**Purpose:** Highest-risk combination: critical + internet-facing + vulnerable. Always Priority 1 remediation.

---

### Query 16: Multi-Hop Attack Path Enumeration

> **⚠️ Optional — slow query.** Only run when Q10a/Q10b reveal high exposure (e.g., many vulnerable devices with identity edges) and the user explicitly requests attack path enumeration. Skip by default in standard reports.

```kql
let IdentitiesAndCriticalDevices = ExposureGraphNodes
| extend rawData = parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties)).rawData))
| extend HasRCEVuln = isnotnull(rawData.vulnerableToRCE)
| extend CritLevel = toint(rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel)
| extend HasCritLevel = isnotnull(rawData.criticalityLevel)
| where 
    (set_has_element(Categories, "device") and 
        (
            (HasCritLevel and CritLevel < 4)
            or 
            HasRCEVuln
        )
    )
    or 
    set_has_element(Categories, "identity");
ExposureGraphEdges
| where EdgeLabel in~ ("can authenticate as", "CanRemoteInteractiveLogonTo")
| make-graph SourceNodeId --> TargetNodeId with IdentitiesAndCriticalDevices on NodeId
| graph-match (DeviceWithRCE)-[CanConnectAs]->(Identity)-[CanRemoteLogin]->(CriticalDevice)
    where 
        CanConnectAs.EdgeLabel =~ "can authenticate as" and
        CanRemoteLogin.EdgeLabel =~ "CanRemoteInteractiveLogonTo" and
        set_has_element(Identity.Categories, "identity") and 
        set_has_element(DeviceWithRCE.Categories, "device") and DeviceWithRCE.HasRCEVuln and
        set_has_element(CriticalDevice.Categories, "device") and CriticalDevice.HasCritLevel
    project 
        RCEDeviceName = DeviceWithRCE.NodeName,
        IdentityName = Identity.NodeName,
        CriticalDeviceName = CriticalDevice.NodeName,
        CriticalityLevel = tostring(CriticalDevice.CritLevel)
| order by CriticalityLevel asc
```

**Purpose:** Discover multi-hop attack chains: RCE-vulnerable device → user identity → critical server. This is the heavy `graph-match` query — use Q10a/Q10b for fast summary stats, and only run this when deep enumeration is needed.

> **Note:** This query may return 0 results if no RCE→identity→critical-device paths exist. That's a positive finding — report as "✅ No multi-hop attack paths from RCE-vulnerable devices to critical servers detected."

> **Performance:** ⚠️ Slow — uses `make-graph` + `graph-match`. Can take 30-60+ seconds on large environments. Filter nodes tightly BEFORE `make-graph` to reduce graph size.

> **Additional patterns:** See `queries/cloud/exposure_graph_attack_paths.md` for 30+ query patterns covering cookie chains, permission analysis, choke point detection, and Azure Resource Graph integration.

---

## Drill-Down Reference Queries

> **⚠️ These queries are NOT part of the standard report workflow.** They use `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` to map vulnerable software to actual file paths on disk. Use them for **targeted drill-downs** when the user asks to investigate a specific software's vulnerabilities, identify cleanup targets, or understand why a software has so many CVE versions.
>
> **Do NOT run these fleet-wide in large environments** — the evidence table can be very large. Always scope to a specific `SoftwareName` and optionally a `DeviceId`.

### When to Use

| Scenario | Query | Trigger |
|----------|-------|---------|
| User asks "why does software X have so many versions?" | Q17 | After Q14 reveals high version sprawl |
| User asks "what files are causing these CVEs?" | Q18 | After Q2 identifies exploitable CVEs for a software |
| User asks "what can I safely clean up?" | Q19 | After Q17/Q18 reveal old extension/app version folders |
| Standard vulnerability report | None | These queries are NOT used in standard reports |

### DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta — Table Reference

> **Beta table:** Schema and table name may change in future Defender releases. The canonical table name is `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` — NOT `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidences` or `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidence`.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `DeviceId` | string | Device identifier (join with `DeviceInfo` for `DeviceName`) |
| `SoftwareVendor` | string | Software vendor name |
| `SoftwareName` | string | Software product name (matches `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities.SoftwareName`) |
| `SoftwareVersion` | string | Detected version (matches `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities.SoftwareVersion`) |
| `DiskPaths` | dynamic | JSON array of file paths where the software was detected on disk |
| `RegistryPaths` | dynamic | JSON array of registry keys evidencing the software installation |
| `LastSeenTime` | string | Last time evidence was observed |

---

### Query 17: Version Sprawl by Source — Per-Software Summary

```kql
// Drill-down: For a specific software, show all versions with file locations
// categorized by source (Azure extension, application, standalone install, etc.)
// Scope: Single software — ALWAYS filter by SoftwareName
DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta
| where SoftwareName =~ '<SOFTWARE_NAME>'
| extend Paths = parse_json(DiskPaths)
| mv-expand Path = Paths
| extend FilePath = tostring(Path)
| extend Source = case(
    FilePath has "Packages\\Plugins", "Azure Extension",
    FilePath has "Program Files\\Microsoft OneDrive", "OneDrive",
    FilePath has "WindowsApps", "Store App",
    FilePath has "Program Files\\dotnet", ".NET Runtime",
    FilePath has "Python", "Python",
    FilePath has "Windows\\System32", "System",
    FilePath has "Program Files\\", "Installed Software",
    FilePath has "dpkg-query", "Linux Package",
    "Other")
| join kind=inner (
    DeviceInfo | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName) by DeviceId
) on DeviceId
| summarize 
    Versions = make_set(SoftwareVersion),
    FileCount = dcount(FilePath),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName)
    by Source
| extend VersionCount = array_length(Versions), DeviceCount = array_length(Devices)
| order by FileCount desc
```

**Purpose:** High-level summary showing WHERE a software's vulnerable files come from — Azure extensions leaving old versions behind, OneDrive version-per-folder sprawl, Store apps, standalone installs, etc. Useful for identifying the root cause of version sprawl and choosing the right remediation approach.

**Substitute:** Replace `<SOFTWARE_NAME>` with the software from Q14 results (e.g., `openssl`, `curl`, `zlib`).

**When to include in reports:** This query produces a compact summary table suitable for including in reports when a specific software dominates the CVE count. Present it under Section 2c (Top Vulnerable Software) as a "Source Breakdown" sub-table for the worst offender.

---

### Query 18: Vulnerable File Paths — CVE to File Mapping

```kql
// Drill-down: Map specific software versions to their on-disk file paths
// and correlate with CVE count per version
// Scope: Single software — ALWAYS filter by SoftwareName
let vulnVersions = DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| where SoftwareName =~ '<SOFTWARE_NAME>'
| summarize CVEs = make_set(CveId) by SoftwareVersion
| extend CVECount = array_length(CVEs);
DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta
| where SoftwareName =~ '<SOFTWARE_NAME>'
| extend Paths = parse_json(DiskPaths)
| mv-expand Path = Paths
| extend FilePath = tostring(Path)
| join kind=inner (
    DeviceInfo | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName) by DeviceId
) on DeviceId
| join kind=leftouter vulnVersions on SoftwareVersion
| summarize 
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName),
    DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceName)
    by FilePath, SoftwareVersion, CVECount
| order by CVECount desc, DeviceCount desc
```

**Purpose:** Maps every vulnerable file path to its version and CVE count. Shows exactly which files on which devices are contributing to CVE exposure. Key for building targeted cleanup scripts.

**Substitute:** Replace `<SOFTWARE_NAME>` with the target software name.

**Common patterns revealed:**
- Azure extensions: `C:\Packages\Plugins\<ExtensionName>\<OldVersion>\...\libcrypto-3-x64.dll` — old extension versions left behind after upgrades, each bundling their own OpenSSL/curl/zlib
- OneDrive: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft OneDrive\<version>\` — every OneDrive update creates a new version folder with bundled libraries
- Store apps: `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\<AppName_Version>\` — managed by Microsoft Store, stale versions auto-cleaned eventually
- Standalone installs: `C:\Program Files\<product>\` — requires manual update or reinstall

---

### Query 19: Stale Extension Folder Detection

```kql
// Drill-down: Find OLD Azure extension version folders still on disk
// by comparing evidence paths against the latest installed version
// Scope: All Azure extension evidence — safe to run fleet-wide (small result set)
//
// ⚠️ PITFALL: Version comparison uses string max() which is LEXICOGRAPHIC.
//    "1.29.98" > "1.29.104" because '9' > '1' at position 5.
//    Review results manually — a "stale" folder with a higher numeric version
//    than "latest" means the comparison inverted. This is a known KQL limitation
//    for dotted version strings with variable-width segments.
DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta
| extend Paths = parse_json(DiskPaths)
| mv-expand Path = Paths
| extend FilePath = tostring(Path)
| where FilePath has "packages" and FilePath has "plugins"
| extend ExtensionName = extract(@"plugins\\([^\\]+)", 1, FilePath)
| extend ExtensionVersion = extract(@"plugins\\[^\\]+\\([^\\]+)", 1, FilePath)
| where isnotempty(ExtensionName) and isnotempty(ExtensionVersion)
| join kind=inner (
    DeviceInfo | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName) by DeviceId
) on DeviceId
| summarize 
    SoftwareVersions = make_set(SoftwareVersion),
    FileCount = dcount(FilePath),
    Devices = make_set(DeviceName)
    by ExtensionName, ExtensionVersion
| as hint.materialized=true AllExtVersions
| join kind=inner (
    AllExtVersions
    | summarize LatestVersion = max(ExtensionVersion) by ExtensionName
) on ExtensionName
| where ExtensionVersion != LatestVersion
| project ExtensionName, StaleVersion = ExtensionVersion, LatestVersion,
    BundledSoftwareVersions = SoftwareVersions, FileCount, Devices
| order by ExtensionName asc, StaleVersion asc
```

**Purpose:** Identifies old Azure extension version folders still present on disk after upgrades. These are the primary source of "phantom" CVEs from bundled libraries (OpenSSL, curl, zlib, etc.) that inflate vulnerability counts. Safe to run fleet-wide because it only returns stale folders (small result set).

> **Known limitation:** `max(ExtensionVersion)` uses lexicographic string comparison, which breaks for version segments with different digit counts (e.g., `1.29.98` vs `1.29.104`). Always review results — if a "stale" version number looks higher than "latest," the comparison inverted. There is no built-in KQL function for semantic version comparison.

> **Regex note:** `extract()` in KQL is case-sensitive. The evidence table stores paths in lowercase (`c:\packages\plugins\...`), so the regex uses lowercase `plugins`. The `has` operator used for filtering is case-insensitive.

> **Remediation pattern:** For each stale extension version folder, the entire folder tree can be safely deleted:
> ```powershell
> Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "C:\Packages\Plugins\<ExtensionName>\<StaleVersion>"
> ```
> After cleanup, TVM will reflect the reduced vulnerability count within 4-24 hours.

> **Common culprits:** Azure Monitor Agent (`AzureMonitorWindowsAgent`), Guest Configuration Agent (`ConfigurationforWindows`), Azure Security Center (`MicrosoftMonitoringAgent`), and other Azure Arc extensions that bundle OpenSSL, curl, or zlib.

## Risk Assessment

Compute an overall risk rating based on query results:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Any: exploitable Critical CVEs on internet-facing assets, OR compliance rate < 40%, OR internet-facing devices with high/critical vulnerabilities (Q10a), OR high blast radius from vulnerable devices to identities/data stores (Q10b) |
| 🟠 **High** | Any: exploitable High CVEs > 5, OR EoS software on critical assets, OR compliance rate < 60%, OR active devices with RTP/TamperProtection/AVMode non-compliant |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Any: total High CVEs > 50, OR EoS software present, OR compliance rate < 75%, OR expired certificates > 10 |
| 🟢 **Low** | None of the above criteria met |

**Cite specific evidence** when assigning risk level (per copilot-instructions.md Evidence-Based Analysis rule).

---

## Per-Device Mode

When user specifies a device name, scope all DeviceTvm queries to that device:

**Add filter to Queries 1-6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14:**
```kql
| where DeviceName =~ '<DEVICE_NAME>'
```

**ExposureGraph queries (7, 15):** Filter by `NodeName`:
```kql
| where NodeName =~ '<DEVICE_NAME>'
```

**Per-device report differences:**
- Section 5b (Attack paths) — filter to paths involving the specific device
- Title changes to: `Vulnerability & Exposure Report — <DEVICE_NAME>`

---

## Known Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|------------|
| `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` requires Defender VM add-on | Query returns empty or error | Skip gracefully, note in report: "Certificate data requires Defender Vulnerability Management add-on" |
| `DeviceTvmBrowserExtensions` may be empty | No browser extension data | Skip section, note as "No browser extension data available" |

| `RemediationOptions` in KB tables contains HTML | Raw HTML in output | Strip HTML tags when rendering in markdown: remove `<br/>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<a>` tags, convert to plain text bullet points |
| `NodeProperties` is a JSON string, NOT a parsed dynamic object | Direct dot-notation like `NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel` returns null through MCP JSON serialization — queries silently return 0 results | **MUST** use double `parse_json(tostring())` extraction: `parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(NodeProperties)).rawData))` then access sub-properties. This is the ONLY reliable pattern for `NodeProperties` access. See Q7, Q10a, Q10b, Q15, Q16 for canonical examples |
| `ConfigurationBenchmarks` in KB contains benchmark mappings | Can enrich report | Optional: extract CIS/NIST benchmark references for compliance mapping |
| DeviceTvm assessments refresh periodically | Data may be 12-24h old | Note data freshness in report appendix |
| `graph-match` queries can be slow on large graphs | Timeout possible | Filter nodes BEFORE `make-graph` to reduce graph size |
| `parse_json()` and `graph-match project` produce dynamic-typed columns | `order by` fails with "key can't be of dynamic type" error | Always wrap in explicit type casts (`toint()`, `tostring()`, `tolong()`) before using in `order by`, `summarize`, or comparisons. Applies to ALL `parse_json()` output — not just `graph-match`. Example: `| extend critValue = toint(rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel)` then `| order by critValue asc` |
| `DeviceTvmInfoGathering` table exists but is NOT used by this skill | Agent may attempt to query it for Defender health data, causing errors due to unfamiliar schema | Defender sensor health is covered by Q9 (SCIDs in `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment`). Do NOT improvise queries against `DeviceTvmInfoGathering` — its schema differs from other DeviceTvm* tables and is not documented here |
| `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` has NO `DeviceName` column | `Failed to resolve scalar expression named 'DeviceName'` | Join with `DeviceInfo \| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName) by DeviceId` to resolve device names |
| `Context` in `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` is double-nested JSON | First `parse_json(Context)` returns an array of JSON strings; items need a second `parse_json()` to extract values | Use `parse_json(tostring(parse_json(Context)[0]))[N]` — e.g., `[0]` for AV mode code, `[2]` for signature date |
| SCID numbers are OS-specific — same control has different IDs per platform | Querying Windows SCIDs on macOS/Linux returns `IsApplicable=0` | Use the SCID mapping: Windows `2010-2030`, macOS `5090-5095`, Linux `6090-6095`. Q9/Q11 normalize OS-specific SCIDs to unified control names |
| Inactive devices have naturally stale AV signatures | Non-compliant `AVSignatures` on devices offline >7 days is expected, not a security gap | Always join `DeviceInfo` to separate active (seen <7d) from inactive devices; report inactive signature staleness as informational only |
| `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` is a Beta table | Table name and schema may change in future Defender releases | Use exact name `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` — NOT `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidences` or `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidence`. If the table returns `SemanticError`, it may have been renamed or graduated to GA — check `FetchAdvancedHuntingTablesOverview` for the current name |
| `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` has no `DeviceName` column | Cannot display device names directly | Join with `DeviceInfo \| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, DeviceName) by DeviceId` — same pattern as `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` |
| `DiskPaths` and `RegistryPaths` are dynamic arrays | Need `parse_json()` + `mv-expand` to flatten into individual paths | Pattern: `\| extend Paths = parse_json(DiskPaths) \| mv-expand Path = Paths \| extend FilePath = tostring(Path)` |
| Evidence queries can be expensive fleet-wide | Large environments have millions of file evidence rows | ALWAYS scope to a specific `SoftwareName`. Never run `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` without a filter |
| `max()` on version strings is lexicographic | `"1.29.98"` > `"1.29.104"` because `'9' > '1'` at the 5th character — inverts the comparison for multi-digit segments | Q19 results must be manually reviewed. KQL has no built-in semantic version comparison |
| `extract()` regex is case-sensitive | Evidence table paths are lowercase (`c:\packages\plugins\...`), but regex patterns with uppercase (e.g., `Plugins`) won't match | Always use lowercase in `extract()` patterns for file paths. Use case-insensitive `has` for filtering |

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table 'DeviceTvm...'` | Table not available in AH | Verify Defender for Endpoint is onboarded; some DeviceTvm* tables require premium licensing |
| `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table 'ExposureGraphNodes'` | Exposure Management not enabled | Report as: "⚠️ Microsoft Security Exposure Management is not enabled in this tenant. ExposureGraph sections skipped." |
| Query timeout on graph-match | Graph too large | Reduce node set with tighter filters; try simpler edge queries first |
| Empty results from DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities | No onboarded devices or no vulns detected | Verify at least one device is MDE-onboarded: `DeviceInfo | summarize by DeviceName | take 5` |
| `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` not found | Requires Defender Vulnerability Management add-on | Skip section, note in report |

### Graceful Degradation

If a table or query fails, **do not abort the entire report**. Skip the affected section and note it:

```markdown
### 6b. Certificate Status
❓ Certificate data not available — `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` table not found.
This may require the Defender Vulnerability Management add-on license.
```

Continue with all remaining sections. The report should always produce output for at least:
- CVE Vulnerability Assessment (Sections 2a-2d)
- Security Configuration Compliance (Sections 3a-3c)

These are available in all Defender for Endpoint tenants.
